You are responsible for building the GUI in `app.py`. 

Your Rules:

- Include secure password-masked inputs for the LLM API Key and GitHub Token.
- Include text areas for User Bio, Links, and Portfolio Aesthetic.
- Include a single "Build & Deploy" button.
- Do NOT write backend deployment logic. Call functions from `backend.py`.
